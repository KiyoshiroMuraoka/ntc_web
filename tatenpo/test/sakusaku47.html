	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<div>
	<ul>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. What is your shipping method?</span><br>A. We will ship items by EMS (Express Mail Service) Japan Post. Since there is a tracking number assigned to each order, it will be possible to track orders that are in transit. We do not offer shipping through companies such as Fedex, DHL, etc.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Is it possible to have my items packed together if I make two or more purchases?</span><br>A. Yes, it is possible. For example, if you purchase two or more items with a shipping fee of $30 each, we will take the total amount. After shipping, we will refund the difference after confirming the amount of the combined shipment. (*Important) Even if two or more items with a $30 shipping fee each are combined into one package, that does not mean that the total shipping fee will be $30. The refunded amount will be determined by the total weight of the purchased items.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Do you accept credit card payments?</span><br>A. We do not accept credit card payments. We only accept payment through Paypal.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Do your products come with English instructions?</span><br>A. There are products with and without English instructions. Please be sure to inquire before making purchases.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Is the language of the electric reel LCD screen English or Japanese?</span><br>A. Depending on the product, it can vary. Please be sure to inquire before making purchases. *In addition, Japanese display screens cannot be changed to English.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Can the amount on the invoice be written cheaper than the actual price at the time of shipping?</span><br>A. We apologize but it cannot. Only the actual price will be written. We will also not be able to write ìgiftî when shipping. We will ship items with ìmerchandiseî written on them.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. How much is the customs clearance tax?</span><br>A. Since the tax amount varies depending on which country you reside in and what items are purchased, we ask that you check with your customs (office?) before making your purchases. Since our store only charges the item price and shipping fee, you will have to pay the customs tax when you receive your purchased items.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. What happens when my package does not arrive?</span><br>A. There may be a delay in transportation. Please do not come to the resolution that it will not arrive and contact our store as soon as possible. We will investigate the cause immediately. Possible reasons may be items being stopped at customs, etc. Please rely on us at once to check the shipping situation.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. What happens when the received goods are damaged or malfunctioned?</span><br>A. Please contact our store as soon upon noticing. We will determine these situations case by case. For breakage during transportation, we will exchange with new items. We will refund the return fee via Paypal later. Please attach a copy of the receipt and send a message to our store.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Do you offer exchanges for purchased goods?</span><br>A. Yes, we do. In the case of an exchange due to the customerís circumstances, the return fee will be paid by the customer. As soon as we receive the returned goods, we will refund the item price. We will not be able to refund the shipping fee. Please purchase new items as you wish on Ebay.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. How long will items arrive after purchase?</span><br>A. We will ship from our store shortly after purchase, but the number of delivery days will vary from country to country. (Around 4-10 days approximately) Depending on the country and goods, it may take time to pass customs from time to time. Therefore, in some cases, it may take more time than the expected date of arrive. </li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Is it possible to purchase items not listed on Ebay?</span><br>A. Yes, it is possible. Please let us know what items you would like to purchase. We will contact the manufacturer to check if they have stock. If they do, we will list it on Ebay after obtaining the item from the manufacturer.
	</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Do you offer discounts?</span><br>A. Unfortunately, discounts are not available. Our prices have already been lowered.</li><br>
	      <li><span class="question">Q. Is it possible to send purchased items to another shipping destination?</span><br>A. No, it is not possible. We apologize but we will only be able to ship items to the registered address of the Paypal account. If you wish to ship to another location, please change your own Paypal registration address to the desired address. Please place your order after the changes have been made. *Changes of address after ordering will be invalid.</li><br>
